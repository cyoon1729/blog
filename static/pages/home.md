## Chris Yoon

I currently work as a software engineer at [Palantir Technologies](https://www.palantir.com/impact/).

Before that, I spent four wonderful years at Columbia University, where I completed my undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Mathematics (Columbia College '24!).

My technical interests are systems programming, programming language theory, and formal methods & verification!
