## Chris Yoon

I currently work as a software engineer at [Palantir Technologies](https://www.palantir.com/impact/), on the
[Foundry Ontology](https://www.palantir.com/docs/foundry/ontology/overview/) team.

Before that, I spent four wonderful years at Columbia University, where I completed my undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Mathematics (Columbia College '24!).

My technical interests are programming language theory, systems programming, and formal methods & verification!
