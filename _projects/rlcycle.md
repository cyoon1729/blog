I wrote a reinforcement learning agents framework back in high school, when when I was 
interested in RL/ML (still interested, but not as much!). I wrote modular implementations
of the state-of-the-art RL algorithms back then (~2019/2020, so think Rainbow-DQN, Soft Actor Critic, etc).

The algorithms implemented are: DQN variants (DDQN, C51, QR-DQN, Rainbow, +Noisy Networks, +Prioritized Exp Replay);
A2C and A3C; original DDPG and Fujimoto's DDPG; and Soft Actor Critic. I've also implemented distributed training (Ape-X),
but in a [different repo](https://github.com/cyoon1729/distributedRL).

This project is no longer maintained, but here's the [github repo](https://github.com/cyoon1729/RLcycle). It was somewhat popular
when it was being actively maintained :) - had about ~270 stars and ~50 forks!
