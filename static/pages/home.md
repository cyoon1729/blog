## Chris Yoon

I am a Software Engineer at [Palantir Technologies](https://www.palantir.com/impact/).

Before that, I spent four wonderful years at Columbia, where I completed my undergrad degree with a major
in computer science and a minor in mathematics (CC '24!). My academic focus was mainly on operating systems, compilers, and programming language theory.
During college, I've also done internships at [Palantir](https://www.palantir.com/platforms/gotham/) (Gotham Ontology),
[Virtu Financial](https://www.virtu.com/market-making/) (high frequency trading), and at [Riot Games](https://www.riotgames.com/en) (service monitoring infrastructure).

I enjoy systems programming â€” things like operating systems, distributed systems, and compilers! I also enjoy studying
programming language theory and formal methods.

#### Reaching out to me
I would not be where I am now without the help I've received from people around me. If I can be
of help to you in any way (e.g. learning, academics, recruiting, mentorship), please
don't hesitate to shoot me an email!
