## Chris Yoon

I am a Software Engineer at Palantir Technologies.

Before that, I spent four wonderful years at Columbia, where I completed my undergrad degree with a major
in computer science and a minor in mathematics (CC '24!). My academic focus was mainly on operating systems, compilers, and programming language theory.

I enjoy systems programming â€” things like operating systems, distributed systems, and compilers!

If you ever want to chat about anything, you can reach me at `cjy2129 [at] gmail [dot] com` :) !

#### Mentorship
I would not be where I am now without the help I've received from people around me. If I can be
of help to you in any way (e.g. resources for learning, recruiting, course planning etc), please
don't hesitate to reach out via the email above!
