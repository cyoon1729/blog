## Chris Yoon

I am a Software Engineer at [Palantir Technologies](https://www.palantir.com/impact/).

Before that, I completed my undergraduate degree at Columbia, with a major in Computer Science
and minor in Mathematics.

My technical interests are programming language theory, formal methods & verification, and systems programming!

If you ever want to chat about anything, you can reach me at `cjy2129 [at] gmail [dot] com` :) !

#### Reaching out to me
I would not be where I am now without the help I've received from people around me. If I can be
of help to you in any way (e.g. learning, academics, recruiting, mentorship), please
don't hesitate to shoot me an email!
