## Chris Yoon

I am a software engineer at [Palantir Technologies](https://www.palantir.com/impact/).

Before that, I spent four wonderful years at Columbia University (Columbia College '24),
where I completed my undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Mathematics.

My technical interests are systems programming, programming language theory, and formal methods & verification!

If you ever want to chat about anything, you can reach me at `cjy2129 [at] gmail [dot] com` :) !

#### Reaching out to me
I would not be where I am now without the help I've received from people around me. If I can be
of help to you in any way (e.g. learning, academics, recruiting, mentorship), please
don't hesitate to shoot me an email!
