<h2>Chris Yoon</h2>
<p>I am a Software Engineer at Palantir Technologies.</p>
<p>Before that, I spent four wonderful years at Columbia, where I completed my undergrad degree with a major
in computer science and a minor in mathematics (CC '24!). My academic focus was mainly on operating systems, compilers, and programming language theory.</p>
<p>I enjoy systems programming â€” things like operating systems, distributed systems, and compilers!</p>

<h4>Mentorship</h4>
<p>I would not be where I am now without the help I've received from people around me. If I can be
of help to you in any way (e.g. resources for learning, recruiting, course planning etc), please
don't hesitate to reach out via the email above!</p>
